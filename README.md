## 👋 Hello, I'm André, Cybersecurity Student
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Cybersecurity, where I specialize in securing systems, networks, and applications against modern cyber threats. My journey in this field is fueled by a passion for technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning.

Over the years, I have gained practical experience in areas such as:

- **Threat Analysis and Vulnerability Management**: Identifying and mitigating risks to ensure secure infrastructures.
- **Incident Response and Monitoring**: Responding to cyberattacks and implementing measures to prevent future incidents.
- **Compliance and Governance**: Ensuring systems align with industry standards like ISO 27001 and NIST.

Explanation of AC2002FR :
  - AC : These are my initials (quite original, I know 😅)
  - 2002 : The year I was born (Generation Z 💪)
  - FR : Indicates that I am French 🇫🇷 (Yes, the land of baguettes)
